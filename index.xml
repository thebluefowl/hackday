      <description>Participation is mandatory! (Exception: Production went down!) If you&amp;rsquo;re in Bangalore, come to office. You can participate solo/in a team of two. You have exactly 24 hours to build. Office will be open through the night. (Yes, we will stock up on Redbull) If you&amp;rsquo;re not in Bangalore, you can still participate. If a majority of your project is built before the hackathon, you maybe disqualified. There are no themes this time!</description>
